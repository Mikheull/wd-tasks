## ðŸš€ Intro
Welcome to the third edition of WeekDev 2022. The WeekDev is a challenge that I launched myself, where I develop an idea in maximum 1 week. At the end of this period I would no longer edit the code ! The goal is to improve myself in development and discover new techniques, new languages.
